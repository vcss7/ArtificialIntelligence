\section*{Game of Chess}

\subsection*{Problem}
Consider the game of Chess (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess). Approximately,
how many different states can a chess game have? You may assume

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We do not consider pawn promotion
    \item We consider each pawn is a distinct piece
    \item We consider only states with no captured pieces, i.e. all states will
        have 32 pieces
    \item We do not consider pawn promotion, castling, or any other special
        cases.
\end{enumerate}

State any other assumptions made and show your work. Your answer does not have 
to be mathematically correct, but should be in the right magnitude for the 
assumptions you have made and make sense based on your math.

\subsection*{Answer}

Additional assumtions will be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pawns can not exist in the 1\textsuperscript{st} or 
        8\textsuperscript{th} rank
    \item Pawns can not stack (i.e. two of the same colored pawns cannot be on
        the same column)
    \item Black/White have one bishop that resides in the black tiles and
        one bishop that resides on the white tiles
    \item How the position came to be is not relevent
    \item Kings can be within one tile of eachother
\end{enumerate}
We will start by calculating the number of possible positions of the pieces
which do not have tile restrictions. Then, we will place the pieces that do have
possible restriction; that is, the bishops and pawns.

First we start with a single rook. Without any other pieces on the board, it has
64 possible positions it can exists on.

Then, we go to a second rook. Since one of the tiles is occupied by the first
placed rook, the second rook only has 63 possible tiles ot exist on.

Similarilly, the third rook will only have 62 tiles that it can possible exist
on.

At this stage, we can recognize a pattern: As tiles get occupied by previous
    pieces, the number of available tiles reduces by one.

The number of states the pieces (minus the pawns and bishops) can be represented
by the following product series.
\begin{equation}
    s_{tot1} = \prod_{i = 0}^{p - 1} (64 - i)
\end{equation}
Where $s_{tot1}$ are the total number of possible states for the pieces without
tiles restrictions and $p$ is the number of pieces placed.

There are a total of 12 chess pieces without the pawns and bishops.
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
    s_{tot1} = \prod_{i = 0}^{11} (64 - i) = 64 * 63 * ... * 53 \approx 1.573 *
    10^{21}
\end{equation}

Now, we must place the pawns and bishops.

The pawns are restricted from the 2\textsuperscript{nd} to the
7\textsuperscript{th} rank and to one of the columns.

This gives each of the pawns 6 tiles to exist on. That means, without any
obstructions, pawns can have a total of
\begin{equation}
    s_{tot2} = 6^{8} + 5^{8} \approx 2.07 * 10^{6}
\end{equation}
where $s_{tot2}$ is the total number of states for the pawns. Note: we will not
filter out states where other pieces are occupying all possible tiles in a
pawn's column since this is negligible considering the magnitude of number in
Equation $2$.

The bishops are each restricted to either the white or the black tiles. This
gives each of the bishops 32 tiles to exist on. That means, without any
other pieces taking any tiles from the bishops, we can have a total of
\begin{equation}
    s_{tot3} = 32^{2} + 31^{2} \approx 9.84 * 10^{5}
\end{equation}
The results from Equations $3$ and $4$ are very negligible compared to the
result from Equation $2$.

We can then say there will be approxamilly \ul{$1.573 * 10^{21}$ possible
states} of the chess position given the initial restrictions.

\section*{Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Problem}

\subsection*{Problem}
A farmer has just bought a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. They must cross the
river to get home, but their small rowboat can only carry the farmer and 1
animal or vegetable at a time. However, the farmer cannot leave the goat
unsupervised with the cabbage, or the goat will eat the cabbage. Similarly,
the farmer cannot leave the goat unsupervised with the wolf, or the wolf
will eat the goat. Draw the full search space starting from the initial
state below. Indicate with different colors or labels which states would
not be further explored because something gets eaten, as well as which
states would not be further explored because they are repeats of previous
states (to avoid cycles)

\subsection*{Answer}

Here is the full search space where $*$ represents the farmer, W represents the
wolf, G represents the goat, C represents the cabbage. In the transitions, the
letter shown next to the edge is the animal or vegetable crossing the river; the
$*$ alone is the farmer crossing the river on his own.
