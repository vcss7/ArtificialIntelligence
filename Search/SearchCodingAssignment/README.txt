        File of the 4 algorithms: BFS, DFS, A* with heuristic 1, and A* with 
        heuristic 2.

Software Requirements:
    python3
    python3 `deepcopy` module from `copy` library
    python3 `deque` module from `collection` library
    python3 `PriorityQueue` module from `queue` library

Comparison Questions:
    Which algorithm performed the fastest?
    which took up the most memory?
    which gave the best solution?

Notes:
    Ties should be broken in the order: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT
