Consider the game sudoku.
Using the provided file, sudoku.py, as a starting point, we are going to 
be implementing the AC3 algorithm for sudoku.

Several helper functions functions, are implemented to help you start. One
simply prints out a sudoku board, the other checks if the sudoku board is
solved. A main function with 3 example problems is also written.

Implement the function solve_sudoku, which takes in a sudoku board as a 2d list
of size [9][9]. Blank spots are represented as '*', all other spots have digits
places. The function does not need a return value, as python list passing is by
reference.
